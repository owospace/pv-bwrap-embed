  <h2>About pv-bwrap-embed</h2>

  pv-bwrap-embed is a simple node application that is<br>
  designed to embed games from calling the Steam API<br>
  to your Discord client. This has been an issue for<br>
  a while, so this application solves that. You do<br>
  not need any additional game setup- it's all done<br>
  through Steams Public Web API. (๑′ᴗ‵๑)
